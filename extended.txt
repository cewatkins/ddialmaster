³Diversi-Dial has a few quirks that can be taken advantage of.               ³
³The most useful is in the login sequence...                                 ³
³The password prompt will accept only numbers for a password,                ³
³and rejects everything else.  this is useful because you can                ³
³give out your passwords in the following format:                            ³
³                                                                            ³
³                                  /037/673/345                              ³
³                                                                            ³
³The "/"(slash) will be ignored at the login and it will                     ³
³accept a password containing them.  How is this useful? If someone has      ³
³their password in a macro, and they  accidently  type  it, the  system      ³
³will think it is a command and will ignore it, so it wont be printed to     ³
³everyone online.                                                            ³
³                                                                            ³
³You may give out a temporary password to someone, without giving them the   ³
³password,  by  simply  relogging  them  and  typing  /IFn/(password here)   ³
³The reason there is a '/' in that command is because the user may hit return³
³when he gets to the password prompt, and your /IF will be printed out to    ³
³everyone online.. this way you are protected.                               ³
³                                                                            ³
³/Hn can be set for anyone who is logging on without a password.  as long as ³
³it                                                                          ³
³is set while they are still at the login, it will force them to logon with  ³
³ the                                                                        ³
³handle you give them.  Ofcourse /Hn still works on everyone, once they are  ³
³online.                                                                     ³
³                                                                            ³
³Another quirk is in the  password system.  You may set the /Z so that it    ³
³reads passwords for a year  or  month  that doesn't exist.. for example:    ³
³/Z07/03/89 12:00 PM 00%05/76   will  set the  system  to  use  passwords    ³
³from the 5th month of 76. %0C/76  will set  them  for  December  of  76.    ³
³%0F/0D will cause it to  use  passwords  from  the month 0F and year 0D.    ³
³/I#nnn,FD will give you the password for user 'nnn' from month F year D.    ³
³                                                                            ³
³Another Quirk is in the /K vote system.  When a sub or more 'Votes' to      ³
³terminate another line, it is reported to the system as line 1 who /K'd the ³
³other line.                                                                 ³
