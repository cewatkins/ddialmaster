Price: $475 One-time license fee for first 7 phone lines
        $50 For each additional phone line in the network
       $100 For each computer connected locally to the network
            with 0 or 1 phone line connection. (This only will
            happen in local area network applications)

The license to use Diversi-DIAL applies only to the original
purchaser, and is NOT transferable.

Initial payment must be by certified check (Sorry, our bad check rate
has been over 10%). Payment for station expansion must be made
BEFORE the expanded lines are put into operation. Anyone expanding
without first paying the $50 per line fee automatically loses the
license to use Diversi-DIAL. Please don't do this! It leads to major
problems - Thanks.

MODEM CONFIGURATION:

The HELLO program on the Diversi-DIAL disk contains an option #9 -
"Modem Configuration". Make a copy of the Diversi-DIAL disk onto
another disk which is NOT write-protected. Then, choose option
number 9 and enter the slot and type of modem which you have.

The program is originally set up for no modems in any slot. You can
run this on any Apple computer without worry. When specifying modem
slot numbers, be sure you enter the correct configuration, or very
strange things will happen. If you specify a Hayes modem in slot 6,
for example, and there is actually a disk controller in slot 6, then
drive #2 will turn on and destroy the disk in the drive!

Apple II+ and //c computers:

Diversi-DIAL requires an Apple //e as the main station. The clock
will not keep correct time on any other Apple compatible, but the
program will run (for demonstration purposes).

Sample version:

The sample version of the program is for demonstration only, and may
not be used to run a station. The sample version works
just like the working version, except all PASSWORDs are "nnn 000 000
0000" regardless of the member number, "nnn" (see below).

The sample disk contains an older version of Diversi-DIAL, without
the link feature. When you send $475 for the real program, it will
contain the latest updates, including the link feature. See the
"Link" documentation for details on how station linking operates.


Diversi-DIAL requires a 64K Apple //e with from 1 to 7 Novation Apple
Cat II, or Hayes Micromodem //e compatible modems. When you decide
to set up a station, we recommend that you go with the full 7 modems.
We highly recommend the Micromodem //e compatible from Transend
Corporation (415 851-3402), which lists for $79. When buying 5 or
more modems for Diversi-DIAL, they will give you the dealer price
(talk to Brett Clippard at Transend). If you don’t have a computer,
you will need to buy an Apple //e (no extras). You should be able to
get one for about $700. You'll also need a 64K extended 80-column
card for the Email.

Next, you should call the phone company to install the 7 phone lines.
Since these lines don't make outgoing calls, be sure to get the most
basic service (metered service, no touch tone). Also, you will need
the "hunt" feature, so that if one line is busy, it goes to the next
line. The easiest way to get connected is to have the phone company
install 7 modular jacks. The modems come with modular phone cords
which will plug right in. You can also do your own cabling if you
wish, to save a little in the installation cost. Our phone company
charges about $22 a line for installation, and $16.50 a month per
line.

Loading the program: The program loads through the cassette port.
This avoids taking up a slot for a disk controller, and avoids the
cost of a disk drive. It takes about 4 minutes to load the program,
and you only have to load once, so the cassette port is ideal. The
HELLO program on the Diversi-DIAL disk contains instructions for
using the cassette.

If you have another Apple, you can run a cable from the cassette-out
on it, to the cassette-in on the Diversi-DIAL computer. To get the
proper output level, you'll have to cut a resistor on the other
Apple. Just cut one side of the 100 ohm (brown-black-brown) resistor
R9 on the Apple //e and lift it a little (it’s R18 on an Apple II+,
check the schematic).

Screen display: The top 2 lines of the screen show the system
status. In the upper left corner is the cutoff time, i.e. a "3"
means a 30-minute cutoff. Moving to the right on the top line, the
numbers 1234567 are caller #'s. Below each number is the channel
(1-4) where that caller is tuned (* means off line). Next on the top
line is a number (normally 4) which is the number of minutes callers
without PASSWORDS get. An inverse "-" next to this indicates
non-PASSWORD callers are locked out (normally it is blank). The
top line also contains the times since signon for each caller, 1-7.
An inverse time means that caller has singed off. An "!" appears to
the right of the time when that caller is signing on. Then a
"+","*", or <space> appears depending on the type of PASSWORD he
enters. Directly to the right of the channel numbers on the 2nd line
is a status character. This character is a period if you just
rebooted and preserved old Email and /SM list (see below). When you
enter /LG from the keyboard, this character becomes an inverse "G".
Otherwise, it is a blank space. To the right of this character is
the call counter. This shows the number of calls received since
midnight (only callers who stay over 2 minutes are counted). The
number of callers for the previous 24-hour period is displayed to the
right of the call counter. Finally, the date and time of day is
displayed at the far right of the 2nd line.

SYSTEM OPERATING FEATURES:

Most features are described in the /I messages. Read through them
carefully.

The sysop is automatically logged on when he types a message.
Commands or /P messages do not log on the sysop. The sysop is
automatically logged off if he doesn't send a message for 8 minutes,
or if he types /L.

There are no signon/signoff messages on channel 4, for complete
privacy. Handles of non-PASSWORD holders are not displayed with the
signoff on channels 2,3,4. Combined with self-squelching, this
prevents non-PASSWORD holders from disturbing PASSWORD holders on
channels 2,3,4.

If only one caller is connected to the system, he will not be cut off
for any reason, so he can wait for someone else to call. The time
limit cutoff and 4 or 10 unanswered messages cutoff described in the
/I messages only happen if 2 or more users are connected.

TERMINOLOGY:

There are 2 classes of passwords recognized by the system. The first
is the numbers entered by all registered members when they sign onto
the system, and are called PASSWORDS (capital letters). A primary
PASSWORD consists of a 3 digit member number, and a 6 digit code,
i.e. 9 digits entered at sign-on. A secondary PASSWORD contains
these first 9 digits, followed by 4 more digits, i.e. a 13 digit
number entered at sign-on.

Primary PASSWORD = 3-digit member # + 6-digit code, i.e. 003 405 902
Secondary PASSWORD = Primary PASSWORD + 4 digits, i.e. 003 405 902 1265

A system password (small letters) is a 6-letter word defined from the
keyboard by the sysop only. A caller who has already entered the
full 13 digit primary and secondary PASSWORD at sign-on, can then
enter this system password to obtain co-sysop powers. Secondary
(system) password are entered as a list by the sysop from the
keyboard only. If a secondary password starts with a +, then it may
be entered by a caller to gain extra time on the system. If it starts
with a letter or digit, then it may be entered by a caller to allow
him to leave a message in the /M slot with the same first letter or
digit as that password.

The 2 password systems evolved separately, and may seem confusing.
However, this gives the sysop enormous flexibility in controlling the
system, which is why I left both systems in the program. Please call
if you have any questions concerning the passwords and PASSWORDS.

SYSTEM COMMANDS:

The sysop's handle appears in the /S list as caller #0. To log the
sysop off, enter /L (normally linefeeds option except from the
keyboard). It is best to log off when you're not there so people
don't try to talk to you. The sysop is automatically logged on by
typing a message.

The following commands require the system password (P) or can only be
done from the main keyboard (K).

Master System Password (K): The first thing to do after the boot is
to set the master system password. This is done by entering /Nxxxxxx
where xxxxxx is a 6-letter word. Only you will know this word, and
it is permanent until you reload the program.

System Password (K): Type /Qxxxxxx where xxxxxx is a 6 letter
password. If you have over 6 letters, the rest are ignored. There
is only 1 system password allowed at any one time, but it can be
changed from the keyboard at any time. If you re-enter the master
system password, then you will get a list of all the secondary
passwords (see below).

To set the secondary passwords, enter: /Q= <password list>

The password list is a list of secondary passwords separated by
spaces. There are 3 types of passwords in the list: cutoff
passwords, co-sysop passwords, and message passwords. All secondary
passwords must fit in 1 line, about 240 characters, so the number of
secondary passwords permitted depends on their length.

A cutoff password begins with a "+", and enables a caller who enters
it to stay connected past the auto cutoff (i.e. longer than 30 min).

A co-sysop password begins with a less than sign, "<". Entering this
password gives /K, /V and /G power, without giving extra time.

A message password allows the caller to enter system messages.
System messages are numbered from 0..9 and A..Z. The first letter of
a message password determines which message the caller with this
password can leave. If the message password begins with a lowercase
letter, then this message cannot be sent to the screen automatically
(see below).

For example, type this from the keyboard: /Q=APPLE alpha +LONG

This sets 3 passwords. If a caller enters /QAPPLE, he can leave
messages in slot "A". If he types /Qalpha, he can leave
messages in slot "A" also, but they can't be sent to the
screen (automatic advertising messages every 5 minutes, see below).
If he types /Q+LONG then he can stay on past the auto cutoff.

Entering a system password (from outside):

Typq /Qxxxxxx where xxxxxx is the same word that was entered from the
keyboard. A secondary PASSWORD is required. If the word is
wrong, the system hangs up. If the word is correct, you will notice
a "<" in your handle, and you have the password powers.

System Password Powers:

After someone enters a correct system password, he is immune from the
automatic cutoff. He can also leave system messages (see below), and
he can hang up on other people who are on the system (see below). He
can control the PASSWORD system with the /U commands, as well.

Setting the time (K):

To set the date and time, enter /Z01/05/85 11:53 AM 00 and hit
return, or /Z02/24/85  1:15 PM 00 (note the spaces before the 1). Hit
return at the exact time you have set. Fill in the correct time
instead of the times shown, of course.

Auto cutoff (K):

The system will automatically hang up on anyone who stays for more
than 30 minutes with all lines busy. To change the cutoff, enter
/Cnx where n is 0..9. A "0" means no cutoff, 1..9 means 10, 20, 30
etc. minute cutoff. The "x" value is 0..9, which is the number of
minutes people without PASSWORDS. To disable the PASSWORD
system, don't enter the "x" value at all.

Rings (P):

Normally, the system picks up on the first ring. To change the
number of rings, enter /Rxn where x=1..7 (modem slot number) and
n=1..9 (number of rings). You can't set the number of rings to be
more than 1, except directly from the keyboard. See the link
documentation for other /R features.

Hanging up (P):

To hang up on someone, enter /Kn where n=1..7 is the caller #.
If /U-991 is set, then /Kn also locks the system for 5 minutes
(see /U-999 below). Enter /KnS to give caller #n the "Cutoff in 30
sec." message.

Giving extended time (P or K):

Enter /Gn to make caller #n exempt from the cutoff.
If you enter /LG from the keyboard, then co-sysops can /G.
If /U-990 is set, /Gn also gives caller #n the power to /K and /V.
This is useful to pass /K power along. With /U+990, you can /G a
co-sysop to take away his /K power.

Validating callers with temporary passwords (P):

Enter /Vn to give caller #n a 10-minute cutoff password. If caller #n
already has a password, you get the "Invalid Caller Number" error.

Entering the Station owner (K):

The station owner's name and address appears at the end of the /I1
message. To change this, enter /O followed by the message. A
semi-colon ";" in the message means start a new line. I.E. to enter
our address, we put /O$10 to:;;DSR Inc.;34880 Bunker Hill;Farmington,
MI 61111;;





Leaving System messages (P) or (message password):

To leave a system message, enter /Mx= (message here), where x=1..9
A..Z. To start a new line in a message, use a semi-colon ";". There
are 36 system message spots available.

Note that a person with a message password can only enter messages to
a single message slot. I.E. if your message password is APPLE, you
can only enter messages startng with /MA=.

If a system message starts with a semi-colon (converted to carriage
return), then the message will be automatically sent to channel 1 and
2 as an advertising message (see auto ads below). One advertising
message appears every 5 minutes (or set interval with /A) on channel
1 and 2. You cannot start a message with a semi-colon if you have a
message password which starts with a lowercase letter (a..z). I.E.
you can reserve a message space for someone but not allow him to
enter a message which is displayed as advertising on channel 1 and 2.

Message #0 (i.e. /M0=) appears as a signon message which everyone
must read.

To chain messages together, end the first message with n\, where "n"
is the number of messages to chain (0-9), and \ is a backslash. A
"0\" chains 10 messages.

Note that the "/MZ" message is displayed to people without PASSWORDs
who try to sign on when the system is locked out (see /U-999 below).

Auto Ads (K):

To turn the automatic ads to channel 1 and 2 on and off, enter /A.
To change the display interval, enter /Ann where 'nn' is the time in
minutes between auto ads (nn=01..99).


Controlling PASSWORDS (P):

PASSWORDS consist of a 3 digit member number, a 6 digit primary code,
and an optional 4 digit secondary code. The PASSWORDS are controlled
with the /U command.

/U-nnn Disables member #nnn (also removes handle from /SM)
/U+nnn Enables member #nnn
/UAnnn Changes member #nnn to alternate primary code A (capital A)
/U     Shows last attempted member #/disabled member # (if any)
       Also shows number of callers since last reboot.
/U<space> From keyboard: Clears disabled member display.

Special /U Features (P):

/U= 9P12A Assign automatic start and stop times for /U-999
/U=10P 1A Another example, A, P means AM or PM - must be uppercase
          Times appear exactly like time on screen (note spaces)
/U-999 Locks out non-members completely
/U+999 Lets non-members on again
/U-998 Members start self-squelched
/U+998 Members not self-squelched
/U-997 Non-member signon messages appear on channel 1 only
/U+997 Non-member signon messages appear on channel 1,2,3
/U-996 Non-member 3 min. cutoff when system full.
/UA996 Non-member 2 min. cutoff when system full.
/U+996 Non-member normal cutoff (0-9 min.) when full.
/U-995 Non-member can't send /P
/U+995 Non-member allowed to send /P
/U-994 PASSWORDs >=256 are "guest" PASSWORDs
/U+994 PASSWORDs >=256 are normal PASSWORDs
/U-993 Members >=100 can't /T2
/U+993 All members can /T2
/U-992 Do not need to enter secondary PASSWORD
/U+992 Members must enter secondary PASSWORD
/U-991 /K locks system for 5 min.
/U+991 /K does not lock system
/U-990 /Gn also gives /K, /V power to caller n
/U+990 /Gn gives infinite time only
/U-989 Members can /K non-members - 1 vote minimum
/UA989 2 vote minimum
/UB989 3 vote minimum
/U+989 Members cannot /K
/U-988 Non-members visible across a link
/UB988 Guests visible across a link
/U+988 Only members visible across a link
/U-987 15 minute call-back delay with /U-992
/U+987 No call-back delay with /U-992
/U-986 Auto /V all members when not full
/UA986 Auto /V all members <512 when not full
/UB986 Auto /V all members <512 (full or not)
/U+986 Don't Auto /V
/U-985 Don't accept remote /E
/U+985 Accept remote /E
/U-984 Cutoff Orig Links at 7AM (Except 'beep' links - see /RnB)
/U+984 Don't cutoff links

15 Minute Call-Back Delay:

If a PASSWORD holder calls back within 15 minutes, he may get a
"Invalid for 15 min." message. If you bypass the secondary PASSWORD
system with /U-992, then this call-back delay normally will not
occur. However, if you still want the call-back delay, even with
/U-992 set, you may also enter /U-987.

With /U-987 set, members must enter their full 13-digit primary and
secondary PASSWORD at signon, to avoid the 15 minute call-back delay.
That is, you have to give out the extra 4 digit secondary PASSWORD to
people you want to be able to call back immediately.

Note that members only have to enter the last 4 digits once per
month. A ":" appears in the /SM list for that member, meaning he gets
an automatic secondary signon (with no call-back delay).

Anyone entering a /Q password (i.e. co-sysops) is immune from the
call-back delay.

The call-back delay does not occur if the system is empty for 5
minutes.

Auto /V options:

With /U-986 enabled, guest PASSWORD holders will receive an automatic
/V when they signon, if the system has not been full for 5 minutes.
This is the same as if the sysop entered /Vn (see /V instructions).

The /UA option does the same thing, but only for guest member
numbers less than 512.

The /UB986 option gives auto /V to members <512, even if the system
is full. Interestingly, this will /V members #000 to #255 who get
the call-back delay.

For example, if you use /U-992 and /UB986, you can then give out 3
types of PASSWORD: Full mambers #000 to #255 for $10 / Paid guests
#256 to #511 for $5 / and unpaid guests #512 to #900.

Vote /K Options:

With /U-989 set, members can "Kill" non-members. This may be used to
give paying members some control over non-members when the system is
not locked.

To be eligible to vote, the "Killer" must be a member with a cutoff
time of 20 minutes or more. That is, people you /V are not eligible
to vote. The "Victim" must be a non member, i.e. someone who did not
enter a valid PASSWORD. People with guest PASSWORDS cannot be
victims.

The /Kn command enters a vote to "Kill" caller #n. Before the victim
is disconnected, all eligible killers must vote against him. That
is, the vote must be unanimous. With /U-989, at least 1 member must
enter /Kn. With /UA989 you need at least 2 members, and with /UB989
you need at least 3 members to disconnect the victim.

A member can have only 1 "Kill" vote active at a time. That is, if
he types /K1 and then /K2, the vote against caller #1 is removed.


With /U-999 in effect, everyone MUST enter a valid PASSWORD to be
connected to the system. If a caller does not enter a valid
PASSWORD, then he will first see the /MZ" message, then the last
part of the /I1 message. You should put instructions in /MZ and /O
telling non-members how to order the regular and "guest" PASSWORDs.

When you enter /U-994, all PASSWORDs greater than or equal to 256 are
treated as "guest" PASSWORDs. This is the same as not entering a
PASSWORD, except that a "guest" PASSWORD allows the caller to signon
to the system with /U-999 in effect. I recommend selling these
PASSWORDs for $0, $1 or $2 and keeping the system locked out during
prime hours. This will allow you to eliminate nuisance callers, but
still register enough people to make it interesting.

Handles for the first 256 members are stored in the /SM list, and
entered automatically when the member signs on (see /I3 and /I6). To
remove a handle from the list, type /U-nnn, i.e. disable that
member's password. To make the member number appear again in the
list (with no handle), type /U-nnn a second time, if you wish. You
can then type /U+nnn to re-enable his PASSWORD.

The sysop should use member #000. This member number is
automatically given a secondary PASSWORD by the system without
entering the last 4 digits.

PASSWORDS change automatically every month. PASSWORDS for different
stations are always different.

Printing a list of PASSWORDS:

Boot the Diversi-DIAL disk and choose menu option #6 - Print
PASSWORDS. Be sure your printer is online and in slot #1. Enter the
last digit of the year when prompted, i.e. 5 for 1985. The
printer will begin printing a list of PASSWORDS. At the left of each
group of numbers is the 3-digit member number. Next is a 2-digit
number showing the month and year, i.e. 15 for January, 1985 or C5
for December, 1985. Then comes the 6-digit primary code for that
month, followed by the 4-digit secondary code. Next, the alternate
"A" code and "B" code are listed. For example:

024 15-605 125 0122 A-404 423 B-209 183
    25-509 023 1224 A-104 445 B-100 023

In January, 1985, member #024 should enter the following numbers at
signon: 024 605 125. If this PASSWORD is revealed, then the sysop
could enter /UA024. Then member #024 would enter this for January,
1985 at signon: 024 404 423. In February, 1985, the PASSWORD changes
automatically to: 024 509 023.

The 4-digit secondary is optional. If you enter /U-992, then it is
never needed. The secondary code does not change for the A and B
alternates. Only member numbers <256 may enter secondary codes, or
receive secondary PASSWORDS.

The system protects itself against unauthorized codes getting out.
If 2 people ever sign onto a system with the same PASSWORD, this
PASSWORD is immediately disabled, and alternate A is enabled. The
member number which is disabled is displayed on the screen to the
left of the date on line 2. You should keep a list of all disabled
member numbers. If you ever have to reboot, use /U to disable these
member numbers again.

Email Operation:

The use of Email is described in /I4. The sysop is always member
#000, and can send or read Email for #000 from the keyboard or
remotely. Email requires a 64K card in the Auxiliary slot on the
Apple //e. Future Email versions may require the Ramworks //e card
from Applied Engineering for more Email space. Buy this card with
only 64K now, and you can add 256K to it later for about $85.

There is 48K of Email space. Messages are stored in the Email
space until they are read, and then the space is reclaimed. If the
Space fills up, the oldest unread message is lost, when someone types
in a new message.

In practice, deleting old messages and reclaiming the email space
keeps email from filling up, and insures everyone gets their
messages. The only way email will be lost is if someone sabotages
it on purpose by sending a lot of junk email. In 1 week, we have
only used 2K of our 48K email space. You can see where your email
pointer is by typing /E?, which will show a hexadecimal number
between $0200 and $B800, where $0200 means no unread email is
present, and $B800 would mean the system is full of unread email.

There is no limit to the amount of Email a member can send. If
someone sabotages the Email by sending junk messages, you can
discover and delete these messages with the /E#nnn and /E*nnn
commands (see summary below).

Note: Enter /E*999 before you do /E? or /E#. The /E*999 forces
"garbage collection", which removes messages which have already been
read. "Garbage collection" occurs automatically once an hour.

The /E? command also shows the month when the oldest Email message
was sent. The command, /E#% will count, and /E*% will delete all the
old email from this month. These commands do not work if the oldest
message was sent in the current month, since this would delete ALL
Email.

Secondary PASSWORDS:

Sending Email requires a secondary PASSWORD, while anyone with a
primary PASSWORD can receive Email. Secondary PASSWORDS are sold
through SYSOPS, and consist of an additional 4 digits at the end of
the primary PASSWORD. When a member enters his secondary PASSWORD
once, the system remembers it until the end of the month (or the next
reboot). He then only needs to enter the primary PASSWORD for the
rest of the month. To enter a secondary PASSWORD, you must have a
member number <256.

You can bypass the secondary PASSWORD requirement, by entering /U-992.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!! READ CAREFULLY!!!

Automatic Initial Data Entry:

Option #8 in the Diversi-DIAL HELLO program menu is "Enter Startup
Lines". When Diversi-DIAL first starts up, it reads through these
startup lines, just like they had been typed from the keyboard.

You can enter a maximum of 2,816 characters in up to 100 startup
lines. The startup lines are useful for entering the /U's that you
want to use on your station, as well as the /C, /N, etc.

If you have an internally linked station, you can enter /R7A as a
start-up line. However, it takes about 3 seconds to actually get the
link established. If you enter a tilde after the /R7A command, the
start-up routine will pause until the /R7A is complete:

/R7A

System Crashes:

The Diversi-DIAL software has proven totally reliable, running for
many months at a time without crashing. If the system crashes, it is
usually due to a power interruption, or hardware error.

Diversi-DIAL now contains a "Glitch Detector". If an auxiliary RAM
bank-switch error occurs, a flashing "G" will appear on the screen.
If this occurs, this means the system is prone to crashing during
Email operations.

If the system does crash, you may see a changing character in the
upper right corner of the screen (also happens when you press reset
on an Apple II+). If you see this, press reset again (with a disk
drive, press reset a 2nd time). Debugging info is as follows:

1000-10FF      0 PAGE
1100           P
1101,1102      PROGRAM COUNTER
1103-11FF      REST OF STACK

1201           X
