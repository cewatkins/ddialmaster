Before using this modification disk, you must first make a copy of
DIAL onto it. Make sure that you have already configured DIAL to
operate with your system (modem configuration, /I1, start-up lines,
etc.). A copy option (6) is provided in the disk menu. Once you
have used it, the execute (1) and cassette (2) functions will then
perform similar to the same functions on the original DIAL diskette
except that the program will now be loaded already modified.

The following documentation explains each feature now available
through the current modification package. A dash (-) following a
title denotes a miscellaneous command which any caller may use. An
(S) denotes a command which requires the System (/Q) password to
be installed while an (M) denotes a command which requires the Master
(/N) password to be installed.


Call Waiting(tm) Saver (-): /CW

This command will allow you to drop carrier for up to 2 minutes
without being disconnected. When a Call Waiting interrupt is
detected, activate the saver and attend to the incoming call. If a
connection is not established before the allotted time expires,
the system hangs up.

To protect PASSWORD holders from accidental devalidation, the
system will not cancel an account which is simultaneously used by
two callers as long as the original caller has /CW activated.
Instead, the first caller will immediately be logged off and the
second will be connected normally.


Instruction Slots (-): /I

Typing /I gives a list of instruction slots along with some
miscellaneous commands. The PASSWORD slot (/I1) remains unchanged.
The channel capacity table (originally /I3) and the copyright
notice (originally /I9) are now combined to form /I2. To provide
sufficient memory for these modifications, the remainder of the
/I slots have been erased.


Alternate Station List (-): /S#

This command produces a condensed version of the local station
list (/S). You will see two lines of numbers divided roughly into
seven columns and a third line containing the time and date. Each
column represents one caller. The first line displays the time of
connection for each caller next to their PASSWORD indicator ("*",
"$", or " "). The second line shows the respective account number
for each caller.

For example, a local station list (/S) which looks like:

#1(T1:?) 001
#2<T2:Janet) 020/#017*
#3[T2:Mike) 004
#4[T1:Larry) 035/#256$
#5(T1:?) 001
#7<T1:Brad) 005/#001*
--> 04/05/87 12:00 PM

would appear as:

001 020*004 035$001     005*
    017     256         001
--> 04/05/87 12:00 PM


Entering Master Password (-): /I+<master>

Entering the Master (/N) password gives the caller full sysop
powers. If an incorrect password is entered, the user is immediately
disconnected. There is no change in the caller status ("<", "[",
or "(") preceding the user's handle. To remove the master password,
type /I-. This is useful for sysops who have people other than
themselves using the slot #0 keyboard to prevent others from
seeing PASSWORDs, etc.


Beep Keyboard Terminal (S): /CB

Type /CB to produce a beep at slot #0, even if beeps are turned off
(/B). The duration of this noise is twice that of the standard bell
(Ctrl-G) so that the two can easily be distinguished.


Dual Channel Links (S): /RnD

Type /RnD to convert a normal link at slot #n into a Dual Channel
Link. Both ends of the link must be converted if the two channels
are to be properly linked. Note that the link status character
changes to a "-".

Dual Channel Links effectively transmit and receive two separate
channels, the primary link channel and the secondary link channel.
The primary is always the channel on which the link itself resides
and is on the /S, while the secondary can easily be determined
from the primary. Together they form the channel pair for that link.

Primary Channel:   1  2  3  4
Secondary Channel: 2  1  4  3

The secondary channel does not affect standard link features such
as internal or external link Email and /P messages. To prevent
confusion concerning the secondary channel, link station lists
(/SP) and logins now contain the channel number of the caller.
Because normal links may still appear, the "#" or "/" method of
primary channel identification might be needed. These should be
ignored if you are on the secondary channel since they will always
appear as "/".


Toggle /K Immunity (S): /RnK

To prevent internal links from accidentally being disconnected, a
feature was installed into the program which would allow only slot
#0 to /K a parallel card whether the Master or System password is
entered or not. Callers using the System (/Q) password, however, can
disable the /K immunity with /RnK then /Kn. Type /RnK to protect
any slot #n from unwanted removal and again to reverse it. Because
all slots are defaulted to being without protection, if you actually
want your parallel cards to be protected, you will have to use the
immunity command as if they are normal lines.


Private Chat (S): /RnP

This feature enables two callers to enter private chat mode. This
chat mode is similar to terminal mode (/RnT) in that two callers
appear as if they were directly connected. Unlike terminal mode,
the target slot may either contain a link or normal caller. Since
the same basic routines are used for both, private chat includes
all features normally supported by terminal mode (/RnT).


Controlling Login Messages (S): /Ux983

When a caller is first connecting, public login messages appear
on channels 1, 2, and 3. To turn the messages off completely,
type /U-983. Because the message appears anytime an incoming call
is detected, messages will appear even when the system is locked.
If these messages become annoying, typing /UB983 will prevent them
from showing up unless the system is unlocked. To re-enable the
login messages, type /U+983. The link command /CS also filters
login messages.


Display PASSWORD (M): /I#nnn and /I#nnn%mm/yy

Typing /I#nnn will display the PASSWORD which is currently active
for the desired account #nnn. Both the primary and the secondary
PASSWORDs will be displayed along with the status of that account
("+", "A", "B", or "-"). This works with both permanent (/Z..%mm/yy)
as well as monthly PASSWORD systems. To display a PASSWORD for any
other month and year, enter /I#nnn%mm/yy.


Force Keyboard Terminal (M): /I/<command>

This forces a command string into the keyboard buffer, terminating
any line being entered from slot #0 at that time. This is helpful
for setting up the system from a remote computer or for executing
keyboard-only commands from remote slots.


Enter Login Message (M): /I;<message>

With this feature you can enter a new login message after the program
is up and running. Like the message slots, using a ";" will start
a new line. Only the first 85 characters are accepted, and the ";"
used to identify this command is also used as part of the message.
A beep will automatically be included at the end of the login
message, but no return will be added.


Set Call Counters (M): /ICxxxxx and /IDxxx

This command allows a sysop to set the call counters seen when users
log into the system. /ICxxxxx sets the total number of calls since
the last reboot. /IDxxx sets the number of calls since midnight.
These commands are especially uesful for preserving the counters
during a reboot or for accumulating the counters in multiple-computer
stations.


Set Locked System Message (M): /IMx

To set the locked system message, enter /IMx where x is the message
slot #(1..9, A..Z). This permits for a selection of locked system
messages. Note that any slot except /M0 may be chosen and that the
ending of the PASSWORD (/I1) slot will still appear at the end.


Entering Passwords (M): /IQ(System), /IQ=(Secondary Passwords),
                        /IQ(Master), and /IN(Master)

These commands function in exactly the same manner as if they were
entered from the keyboard except that they can be executed by any
user with the Master (/N) password entered.


Station List Interval (M): /ISnn

Link station lists (/SP) are normally generated every 5 minutes.
This command changes the interval between link station lists to
any 2 digit number between 1 and 99.
